MOVEMENT - Original artwork or game-like play (creativity) demonstrating understanding of animation and variables (quality)

This project started out with me trying to make a 2D knife, and rapidly escalated into what you are now seeing.

This is by far my favourite of the portfolio items, and took the longest (in case that wasn't obvious).

The 2D knife I was initially working on was supposed to swing down as if coming towards the 'camera'/viewpoint, however I couldn't seem to achieve this in a 2D space. 
So I converted the initial knife shape into 3D, then added a 3D handle and the other side of the knife's blade. 
I moved each detail on the blade out a pixel from the last to give it a sense of depth, then worked on getting the knife to rotate (the prompt was MOVEMENT after all).

I became distracted by the lighting elements available in 3D, so decided to add some to highlight the knife's movement (whilst making them able to be toggled to maintain the colours I had initially picked for the knife). I went for a red and blue colour scheme for the lights, to mimic police lights and maintain my horror theme.

The final step was to add the trail fading over time, this took hours of trial and error as I struggled to get it to curve and follow the knife's path, instead of just sort of sticking out from the knife and turning with it like that (it's difficult to explain, but it looked really stiff before). The result is something I am incredibly proud of, and have shamelessly spent a lot of time staring at it because it seems to be some sort of ADHD trap.

AND, unlike prompt 1, the canvas resizes to the window (although the knife maintains the same size, just repositioning to the centre of the window).
