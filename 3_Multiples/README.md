One of the more simplistic prompts. Maintaining the horror theme, I went for blood splatters on a dark background.

The most difficult bit of this was getting the splatters to fade correctly, so the screen was 'just the right amount' of filled, otherwise it would get too crowded.

If I had more time for this prompt, I would try and make the blood splatters less uniform. Currently they are all circles of varying size, which is not how real blood splats would work, they are more likely to be irregular and uneven 'splodges'. I think this could be doable, but was just not achievable within the time constraints for me this time.
