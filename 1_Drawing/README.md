DRAWING - illustrates creative experimentation (creativity) and technical understanding (quality) of pixel coordinates, use of colour, and shape.

As with most of my work, I wanted to find a way to link this back to horror (my autism hyperfixation).

Seeing as this project required focus on manipulating and positioning shapes, I thought a really interesting shape to construct would be ghostface's mask (from the SCREAM franchise).

It was a very difficult shape to get right, but once I had it it was fairly easy to build the rest of the the body/hood around it. The eyes were a particular challenge too, as they are an odd shape formed of various curves.

If I had more time for this project, I would have liked to add some blood droplets to the background, and to have made the drawing resize dynamically with the window instead of remaining at a static size no matter what.
