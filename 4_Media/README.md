MEDIA - Tests knowledge of incorporating external media assets (quality), and shows inventiveness by generating own assets (creativity).

I decided to take a break from my usual horror theme for this one, and instead include my other favourite thing - my cat. His name is Merlin, and he is delightful.

Given the prompt was media, I thought it would be apt to create a windows XP style file viewer full of Merlin's pictures of himself (of which I have many, many, many). I'm not sure whether it counts for generating own assets, but I did take all these pictures. 

Make sure you turn your volume up too for the clicking sound effects!

I really like this one, if I had more time I would make it so you could look in other folders (See the ones labelled Dotty and Elsie? Those are my dogs!), and improve the stylisation of it as a whole. Maybe add a media player for some music. But as it is, this is definitely one of my favourites of the 5 prompts.

*I am having an issue on mine where, if you maximise the web window, the prev and next buttons duplicate so there is a second set on the left, in the wrong place. I'm not sure why this happens, and do not have time to fix it. Oopsies.
